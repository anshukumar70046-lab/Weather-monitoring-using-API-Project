# Weather-monitoring-using-API-Project
The process of weather monitoring using an API involves requesting weather data from a provider's server and integrating that data into an application or system. A Weather API acts as a messenger, delivering real-time, forecasted, or historical weather information gathered from sources like satellites, radar, and weather stations.
